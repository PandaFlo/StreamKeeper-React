## Overview

StreamKeeper is designed to cater to movie and television enthusiasts who wish to have quick and easy access to extensive media information. By harnessing the capabilities of the TMDb API, the application serves as a powerful tool for discovering films and shows, exploring detailed descriptions, viewing trailers, and checking ratings and reviews. The application’s architecture is built for scalability and performance, providing users with a seamless browsing experience.

## Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, ensuring a consistent and optimized user experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. It adapts the layout to suit the screen size, making navigation intuitive.

- **Dynamic Search**: Users can utilize a dynamic search bar to find movies, TV shows, and actors quickly. The search functionality is designed to provide real-time results, enhancing user engagement by allowing immediate access to relevant content.

- **Cache Mechanism**: StreamKeeper implements a sophisticated caching system that stores frequently accessed data. This approach minimizes unnecessary API calls, leading to faster load times and a smoother user experience. The cache helps to reduce the latency in retrieving data, ensuring that users spend less time waiting and more time exploring.

- **Comprehensive Detail Pages**: Each media item has a dedicated detail page that provides users with in-depth information, including descriptions, ratings, reviews, and related content. This feature allows users to gain a thorough understanding of their favorite films and shows.

- **User-Friendly Navigation**: The Navbar is designed for easy navigation, featuring clear links to major sections of the application, including the home page, browse page, and specific categories for movies and TV shows. The layout promotes an intuitive browsing experience, making it simple for users to find what they are looking for.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: The user interface is built using React.js, allowing for a modular approach to component development. React enables efficient updates and rendering of the UI, ensuring a fast and responsive experience.

- **Styling**: CSS is utilized for styling components, with a focus on modern design principles that enhance usability and aesthetic appeal. CSS-in-JS libraries can be integrated for scoped styles, which keep styles organized and maintainable.

- **API Integration**: Axios is employed to handle HTTP requests to the TMDb API, enabling the application to fetch real-time data effectively. Axios simplifies the process of managing requests and responses, streamlining error handling and response processing.

- **State Management**: The React Context API is used for global state management, allowing components to share data without prop drilling. This approach enhances the application's scalability by providing a centralized state management solution.

- **Testing**: The project employs Jest and React Testing Library to ensure component reliability and functionality. This setup allows developers to write unit tests for components, ensuring that they behave as expected under various conditions.

## Getting Started

To get started with StreamKeeper, follow these instructions:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version X.X.X or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
 ```
### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd streamkeeper-react
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Usage

Once the application is running, you can navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser to start using StreamKeeper. Explore the various features, search for movies or TV shows, and dive into detailed information about your favorite content.

## Available Routes

StreamKeeper provides a variety of routes that users can access:

- `/` - Home Page: The landing page where users can find the latest content.
- `/browse` - Browse Page: A curated list of movies and TV shows for exploration.
- `/movie/:id` - Movie Detail Page: Detailed information about a specific movie.
- `/tv/:id` - TV Show Detail Page: Detailed information about a specific TV show.
- `/search` - Search Results Page: Displays results based on user queries.

## Components

The application consists of various reusable components that promote maintainability and scalability. Each component is designed to serve a specific purpose within the application, ensuring a cohesive user experience.

### Example: Navbar Component

The Navbar component serves as the main navigation element, providing links to different sections of the application. It is built to be responsive and adapt to various screen sizes, enhancing user accessibility.

## Models

The models in StreamKeeper define the data structures used throughout the application. Each model represents a different entity, such as movies, TV shows, and persons, and encapsulates the properties relevant to that entity.

### Example: Movie Model

The Movie model contains attributes such as title, release date, overview, and ratings. This structure allows the application to manage and display movie data effectively.

## Services

The service layer handles API calls to retrieve data from TMDb. Each service is dedicated to a specific domain, such as movies or TV shows, and encapsulates all the necessary logic to interact with the TMDb API.

### Example: MovieService

The MovieService is responsible for fetching movie data, including popular movies, specific movie details, and searching for movies based on user input. By centralizing API interactions, the service layer simplifies the components and promotes cleaner code.

## Caching Mechanism

StreamKeeper incorporates a caching mechanism to enhance performance and user experience. Cached data reduces the frequency of API calls, allowing the application to retrieve previously fetched data quickly. This results in faster load times and less waiting for users, particularly when navigating back to previously viewed content.

## Testing

To ensure the application runs smoothly, comprehensive testing is implemented throughout the codebase. Using Jest and React Testing Library, each component undergoes rigorous testing to confirm that they function as intended. This process helps identify and rectify issues before deployment, ensuring a reliable user experience.
